Functionality to add:
X. Add more properties in a recipe, such as: Time.
X. Functionality to increase/decrease portions and then the ingredients needed should be changed proportionally.
   Also possibility to alter the amount of one ingredient, and the rest should change to be proportional.
X. Improve how instructions are being added and visualized. Introduce steps.
   Each step is one box of information, and so on.

   Involves implementing a Favorite tab. Or Filter functionality.
X. Add favorites tab. OR rating? Mark recipe as favorite.
X. Add filter functionality.

Performance improvement:
X. Look into: "I/Choreographer: Skipped 62 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread."
X. Handle loading all tabs at start better.

Firebase improvements:
X. Require double password entry for cases like change password, and sign up.
X. Implement profile picture.
X. Improve how recipes are saved. Currently, the entire list is saved/loaded for every save/load.
   Only the saved/loaded recipe should be involved in a save/load.


Design:
X When navigating to and back between activities, make the animation "swipe to right/left". Currently the animation goes up/down.
X Everything needs to be better looking...
